In this MySQL demo, we embark on a journey to design, create, and manipulate tables within a relational database, leveraging powerful SQL statements and techniques.
Beginning with table creation using the CREATE TABLE statement, we define the structure and schema of our database, specifying data types, constraints, and relationships.
Once our tables are in place, we dive into data manipulation using a myriad of SQL commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, UNION, ETC.
We also harness the power of joins to combine data from related tables and aggregate functions to derive meaningful statistics and insights.
Through this demo, we demonstrate the prowess of SQL in managing relational databases, unlocking the potential for robust data manipulation and analysis.
